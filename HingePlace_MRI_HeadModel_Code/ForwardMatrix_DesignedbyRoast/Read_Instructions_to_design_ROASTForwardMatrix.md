To design the forward matrix, first download the roast software from their github: https://github.com/andypotatohy/roast. Replace the standard roast.m file with the modified version provided here, and run the command: roast([],'leadField','simulationTag','MNI152leadField'). Use the save_forward_mat.m to save the forward matrix. Save the .mat file in this folder to run the code. You can use any other forward matrix designed by the roast by saving it into a .mat file such that it is possible to read Mx3XN matrix into python (might need to update the reading part in the files). The forward matrix was designed using Roast v3.5. For newer releases of roast, there may be some dependencies clashes that would need to be resolved.
